# Deep Reinforcement Learning in Super Mario Bros

Super Mario Bros game is the ....
Instead play the game by people, we will create the AI agent can learn and play this game.
This is the hard problem, because the state space is very large so we can't using other algorithm like Q-learning, Sarsa Learning.

## Description about project
----
- Implement the Deep Q Network for Gym Sumper Mario Bros game.
- Eperiment some Neuron network architectures appied for problem.


## Some evaluations
